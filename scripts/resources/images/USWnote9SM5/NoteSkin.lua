--Unlimited Stepman Works Noteskin.lua for SM 5.0.12

--I am the bone of my noteskin
--Arrows are my body, and explosions are my blood
--I have created over a thousand noteskins
--Unknown to death
--Nor known to life
--Have withstood pain to create many noteskins
--Yet these hands will never hold anything
--So as I pray, Unlimited Stepman Works

--We are using USWdefault9SM5 as fallback
