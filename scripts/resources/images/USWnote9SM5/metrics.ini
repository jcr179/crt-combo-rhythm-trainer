#USW Metric Version V3 Small Addition Version
#Made for Version Stepmania 5.0.12

#I am the bone of my noteskin
#Arrows are my body, and explosions are my blood
#I have created over a thousand noteskins
#Unknown to death
#Nor known to life
#Have withstood pain to create many noteskins
#Yet these hands will never hold anything
#So as I pray, Unlimited Stepman Works

[Global]
#Noteskin this noteskin falls back on
#We normaly make this fallback on common
#Because its the global noteskin every default fallsback on to
FallbackNoteSkin=uswdefault9sm5

#Texture Coord Offest Info

#This is the TextureCoordOffset which we use for Rhythm colored noteskins
#If you dont want to use it, just keep the value 0
#Rhythm colored noteskins are noteskins that have different colors for every
#4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and so on
#To use this you need to use simple math because it isnt based on the size of 
#the image but its based on the total value of the size which is 1
#So if you got 9 frames (including  192nd)
#You need to run this simple math
# 1 / 9 = 0.11111111111111111111111111 (and so on)
#Because using the entire value is to long, lets make it smaler to 6 digits
#You can make it longer if you want but lets keep it nice to 6 digits
